# We install signing keys as per https://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/
#
# Note, above page says to create /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/google.gpg.
# /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome will end up creating google-chrome.gpg
# with different binary contents.  The duplication does not cause any
# errors, and it means the ansible role is not fighting with cron.
#
# Note, get_url in check_mode would always show "changed"
# (tested: ansible 2.9.10).  Solution: first download a local copy,
# even in check mode.  Ignore the changed status of this download.
# Then, copy this file to the target.  The second task will show
# the correct changed status in all cases.
#
# Ansible says "upgrade to latest" is not considered best practice,
# at least for installing packages.  However, it can be useful here
# to remediate a system with an out-of-date key.  This problem occurs
# when a system has been left without updating for too long.  For some
# reason, running the google-chrome cron job does not fix it - it
# never downloads a new key.
