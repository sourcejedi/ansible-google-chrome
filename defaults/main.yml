# On Fedora Linux, roles that work like sourcejedi.google-chrome want to know
# whether or not fedora-workstation-repositories is installed.  Therefore
# they need to enforce the state of this package.  I think of this task as a
# virtual role.  I haven't implemented it as a separate role, because I'm not
# too keen to force Fedora users to pull it in manually, and it seems
# confusing if I pulled it in automatically for Debian users.
